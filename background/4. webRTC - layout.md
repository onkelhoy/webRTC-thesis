# WebRTC part - layout 
This is the final part of the background, this part comes after the network topology part but stands more or less on its own (not continuous)

1. __Begin with peer-to-peer in the browser__ \
mention (if any) solutions of P2P in the browser such as extensions (I think skype at least had some)
2. __Tie it nicely with webRTC__ \
explain why webRTC is very interesting : as the support is very good since it's natively built in most browsers 
3. __Explain webRTC__ \
how it works, maybe give examples on how it's used for some solutions in multiplayer games how it's used (very limitless) \
and go into the drawbacks of webRTC (the peer connection limit : thus we have our main problem baked in)


This concludes the background, now we have our requirements from the multiplayer game part \
we have the information needed about P2P and we've picked some topologies \
and we have information about webRTC and also know its limits (which will be our focus to overcome with the topologies)
