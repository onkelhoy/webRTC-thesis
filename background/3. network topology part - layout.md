# Network Topology part - layout 
From the previous part (P2P) 

1. __Explain what network topologies are (brief)__ \
not to much as this should be quite obvious for the reader,
but explain things such as why this helps P2P meet the multiplayer requirements
2. __Go in detail (briefly)__ \
mention some P2P topologies and go in detail about them \
details such as - how they work, what they do good
    - not to much info since later the comparative study will explain more how things work and especially what they do good/bad
