# Background - layout
This is the recipe layout for the background:

1. __Begin with writing the multiplayer game part__ \
in order to get base requirements for the network \
write about what games needs for the network and what different techniques exists (p2p and client-server)
2. __Go on about P2P__ \
describe what it is, how it works etc
3. __From the P2P go into the P2P network topologies__ \
mention some topologies to later be compared 
4. __Tie it all together with P2P in the browser using the webRTC API__ \
explain how it works why its a good solution for peer-to-peer
