# Multiplayer part - layout
1. __Start by give some introduction about gaming__ \
how much it has grown, how much money there is to it
2. __Smoothly go into multiplayer games__ \
how much it has helped the gaming industry, how much it's growing (multiplayer games) thus why it's so important for the gaming industry (real time communication)
3. __Go into the requirements that is expected from the network__ \
of the multiplayer games, (latency, synchronous) \
try cover as much as possible about online gaming \
 security, anti-cheating etc 
4. __Set up the benchmarks for this project__ \
in other words, filter out the irrelevant parts such as anti-cheating in order to set a focus (_latency, scalability, synchronous, availability, drop-in/out of players_)
5. __Mention how networking has been done for games__ \
focus on client-serverÂ and then go into P2P (which is the next part)
