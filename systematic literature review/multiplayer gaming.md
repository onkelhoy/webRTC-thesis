# Systematic Literature Review on "multiplayer gaming" 

__The purpose__ for this SLR is to get knowledge about the _standards of networks_ for multiplayer games i.e. _what the expected requirements are for a network_. Thus this SLR will not be so strict since these requirements are more or less the same and should be written quite early in the articles.
